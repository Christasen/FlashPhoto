## Abstract
This is a software design and development project which has been completed by Guangyu Yan and the CSCI3081 instructors in the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. We developed software called FlashPhoto which is a digital painting and image-editing tool. It mainly contains eight filters and eight tools to process photos or design and draw new images. With some similar features of Flashphoto, the Medical Images Analysis(Mia) tool aims to support the medical analysis. The mia application is powerful but much smaller than the FlashPhoto since it is a very special-purpose tool. Also, I developed two different modes for Mia to run, the graphics mode and command line mode.
