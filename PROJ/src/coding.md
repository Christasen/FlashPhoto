Coding Style
=============
Welcome to the CSCI3081W project coding style main page!


## Coding style
We followed the following google style

        ◦ Class interfaces follow McConnell’s guidelines of implementing just a
        single abstract data type within each class and using consistent levels of abstraction.

        ◦ Class and important variable names are informative.

        ◦ Objects that are dynamically allocated using new are later deleted and pointers are set
        to NULL when they do not point to valid memory locations.

        ◦ Comments are included to describe the intent of each public member function in every class.

        ◦ Additional comments are included in areas where the intent of the code is not obvious
        from reading the code itself and where future programmers would encounter a special case or
        unusual aspect of the code that they would find surprising.

        ◦ The tests show evidence of thinking about aspects of the design that are “worth testing”
        (e.g., boundary conditions, areas of change).
