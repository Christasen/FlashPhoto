High Level Design Mainpage
=============
Welcome to the CSCI3081W project high level design page!

In this project, we used many design patterns to construct the two application.
1. MVC has been used in constructing the overall structure of the two application and the imagetools.
2. Template method, factory method has been used in constructing the imagetools library.
3. Other software design strategy has been used in this project as well.


In order to present our structure clearly, we used the UML diagram here
